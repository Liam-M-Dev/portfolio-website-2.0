# Portfolio Web Site

## Purpose

The purpose of this was to build a new portfolio website using the JavaScript framework React and CSS framework TailwindCSS.  
I wanted to develop a better understanding on how react components worked and how to use a CSS framework to do the styling.  

There are a few features to be still implemented, some minor responsive fixes to larger screens, a dark mode/light mode and some interactivity with page links.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- React
- TailwindCSS

- Development done in VScode
